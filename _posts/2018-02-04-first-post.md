title: Try to write blogs

First post as a start point.

### Try an image
![Avator]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/K.jpg)

### Try a link
[Github](https://github.com/)

### Try a math equation
Inline examples are $$x$$, $$y$$, and $$z^2$$.
Below is an offline example.

$$
1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + \dots + n = \dfrac{n^2 + n}{2}
$$

Works like a charm!

Happy coding!
